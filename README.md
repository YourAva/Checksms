# CHKSMS ðŸ”Ž
CHKSMS is a simple program that I wrote, it combines the use of both shell and C to crossreference hashes of files with a [known list of malicious hashes](https://github.com/eminunal1453/Various-Malware-Hashes). This is a pretty simple project that i've thrown together and I plan to do a little bit more with this program

## How to use
If you wish to use this program, it's quite simple. Enter wherever you've downloaded the directory and enter it. Once there, run bash ./checkSums.sh, it may ask for sudo privelages, if so, allow it.
If you wish to change the directory it scans in, there's a simple variable you can change at the very top of the sh script, just open it with nano or vim and edit it and you're good to go!

## Final notes
Obviously, **THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON LINUX**. It runs inside of an SH script and uses linux commands, therefore, if you're running this on a windows machine it will not work. I've tried this on two OS' so far, both Kali Linux and Ubuntu server and they both seem to run the script perfectly.
